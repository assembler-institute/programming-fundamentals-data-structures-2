/**
 *
 * You will have to return an array in JSON format of the following data:
 *
 * The function will receive an array of users in JSON format
 *
 * You will have to:
 *
 * 1. json parse the `data` param to get an array of objects
 *
 * 2. create a new array of objects with the information about each user
 *    in the `data` array so that:
 *
 *    2.1 if the user has the property of `paid` set to false,
 *        you will have to skip the user from the final array of users.
 *
 *        Only include the users with the property of: `paid: true`
 *
 *    2.2 user should have their name split in `firstName` and `lastName`.
 *
 *        The user you receive will have their name as a
 *        full name under the `name` property.
 *        name: 'ana maria' => firstName: 'ana', lastName: 'maria'
 *
 *    2.3 you will have to use `trim()` and `toLowerCase()`
 *        on the email property so that it doesnâ€™t have empty spaces
 *        on each side and its written in lower case.
 *        '      UseR@EmaIl.COM   ' => 'user@email.com'
 *
 * 3. return the array of objects of users in JSON format with `JSON.stringify`
 *
 * The `data` parameter you receive has the following structure:
 *
 * users = [
 *    {
 *        name: 'string string',
 *        paid: true,
 *        email: '   name@mail.COm',
 *    },
 *    {
 *        name: 'string string',
 *        paid: false,
 *        email: '   NAmE@MAil.COM',
 *    },
 *    {
 *        name: 'string string',
 *        paid: true,
 *        email: '  NamE@MAil.COM    ',
 *    },
 *    {
 *        name: 'string string',
 *        paid: true,
 *        email: 'NAME@MAil.COM    ',
 *    },
 * ];
 *
 * The final `result` should have the following structure
 * in JSON format:
 *
 * result = [
 *    {
 *        firstName: 'string',
 *        lastName: 'string',
 *        paid: true,
 *        email: 'name@mail.com',
 *    },
 *    {
 *        firstName: 'string',
 *        lastName: 'string',
 *        paid: true,
 *        email: 'name@mail.com',
 *    },
 *
 *   ...
